So, therefore, it generates 1,20,000 units per month and 14,40,000 units per year. A common size solar panel array is usually around 5kw and takes up around 400 square feet of space. One acre of solar panels can produce over 350 mwh of electrical energy annually. As the costs of solar materials decrease, the amount of profit is likely to be significantly higher.
